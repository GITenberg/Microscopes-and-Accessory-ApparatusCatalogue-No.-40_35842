<h2><a name="New_Constructions" id="New_Constructions"></a>New Constructions.</h2>


<p>Since issueing our last catalogue, a number of new apparatus and
accessories have been added. The following are the more important ones:</p>

<p>1. A completely <b>new stand "A"</b> with extra fine micrometerscrew
transmitting its movement directly to the tube. The stand is of elegant
appearance and large dimensions, making it especially well adapted for
work in photo-micrography.</p>

<p>2. <b>Stand I</b> is now fitted out with the new special fine adjustment (each
division 1/1000 mm).</p>

<p>3. <b>Stand II</b> with round centering stage.</p>

<p>4. <b>Stand IV</b> is replaced by a model of larger size.</p>

<p>5. <b>Photo-micrographic apparatus</b> for use in horizontal and vertical
position, having joint for inclination, large size bellows and
plateholder.</p>

<p>6. <b>Large projection-apparatus</b> for electric lamp of 30 Amp&egrave;re with triple
collecting lens of 210 mm aperture.</p>

<p>7. <b>Objective 1 a</b> with adjustable mounting and changeable magnification.
It is an excellent objective of low power for general purposes, having a
comparatively short working distance.</p>

<p>8. <b>Objective 1 b</b> with changeable magnification of lowest power, as far
down as two diameters. It serves for drawing extended sections and
specimens.</p>

<p>9. <b>Saccharimeter after Mitcherlich</b> improved form.</p>

<p>10. <b>Trichinoscope</b>, projection-apparatus of strong and simple
construction.</p>

<h2>Preface.</h2>


<p>Our American Branch house in New-York under the management of Mr. Wm.
Krafft has now been established for over 10 years. This period has
witnessed a gradual development of our business in the United States,
making it necessary to establish some years ago a Western Branch in
Chicago of which Mr. R. Gibson has charge.</p>

<p>The cordial reception our firm received has been most gratifying and we
take this opportunity to thank our many patrons for their kind
consideration.</p>

<p>It is our aim to co-operate with the scientists and construct new
apparatus to meet their needs or improve others wherever this is
possible.</p>

<p>The foregoing list of additions and improvements made since issueing our
last catalogue is proof that we spare no time nor labor to hold pace
with the increased wants of modern times.</p>

<p>We have now manufactured and sold over 71000 compound microscopes and
31000 oil immersion objectives, a large number of which are used in the
laboratories of Universities, Colleges, and other Educational
Institutions of the United States.</p>

<p>We are prepared at New-York and Chicago to repair our instruments or
make alterations at short notice and at lowest prices. The optical part
of a microscope should invariably be sent to the maker, as he is best in
a position to repair same and has an added interest to bring a lens back
to its original quality or even improve it.</p>

<p>Microscopes, bacteriological apparatus and all other scientific
instruments or preparations expressly imported for use in educational
institutions are exempt from duty.</p>

<p>Catalogues may be had on application by addressing:</p>

<h2><a name="Objectives_and_Eye-pieces" id="Objectives_and_Eye-pieces"></a>Objectives and Eye-pieces.</h2>


<p>In the manufacture of our objectives only such glass is employed as has
been subjected to the most rigid scientific tests. By these the exact
index of refraction and the exact degree of dispersion of the glass are
determined, and with these data available it is possible to very
perfectly correct both spherical and chromatic aberrations while still
making use of wide angular apertures in the objectives.</p>

<p>The precise mathematical calculation, combined with accurate
systematical working and testing methods, make it possible for us to
guarantee our objectives to be all of equal and excellent quality.</p>

<p>Every objective before leaving our hands, is subjected to the most
careful test, and only such lenses as are of the highest grade, are sent
out.</p>

<p>For the past seventeen years we have used glasses manufactured by Schott
&amp; Co. of Jena. This glass has many points to recommend it for the
construction of optical instruments, and only such kinds are employed by
us, which have for many years been thoroughly tested as to their
durability.</p>

<p>Our lenses are therefore absolutely permanent. Objectives of the earlier
type which have become cloudy, we shall gladly repair.</p>

<br /><br />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/007.jpg" width="600" height="235" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The three illustrations given above afford an idea of the plan of
construction of our achromatic objectives.</p>

<p>The first figure represents the plan of our low power objectives, and it
will be noted that they consist of two doublets, or triplets each
carefully corrected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The central figure shows the construction of our high power dry
objectives. A hemispherical front lens is combined with two doublets or
sometimes triplets. The front lens is the chief magnifier of the
combination, while the other lenses serve to correct the various
aberrations.</p>

<p>The Oil-immersion, represented by the last illustration consists of a
front lens, hemispherical, behind which is a meniscus, which is in turn
followed by a doublet and a triplet, these latter acting as the
correcting lenses of the combination.</p>

<p>We manufacture both <b>Achromatic</b> and <b>Apochromatic objectives</b>. They differ
in that the glasses made use of in the apochromatics and the manner in
which they are combined permit a more perfect correction of chromatic
aberration. This advantage is not gained without a certain sacrifice of
simplicity in construction; by avoiding the use of flint glass having a
high refractive index and substituting materials to take the place of
crownglass. The apochromatics as a matter of fact do resolve the fine
markings of test objects (butterfly scales and diatomes) somewhat more
clearly than the achromatics, but the difference is slight and in
ordinary stained microscope preparations is hardly detectable.</p>

<p>The correction of both achromatics and apochromatics is complete. The
ordinary Huyghenian eye-pieces are consequently well adapted for use
with the objectives of either construction. Only with the highest powers
is it desirable to make use of the so-called "compensation" eye-pieces.</p>

<p>The achromatics and Huyghenian eye-pieces are also well adapted to the
requirements of photomicrography, special objectives being unnecessary
for this purpose. This statement is substantiated by the excellent
results obtained with our achromatic objectives, as shown in the
photomicrographs accompanying our brochure on
Photomicrography:&mdash;"Anleitung zur Mikrophotographie".</p>

<p>In making use of the higher power objectives&mdash;from No. 5 on&mdash;it should
be remembered, that the lenses are corrected for cover glasses of 0,17
mm in thickness and for a microscope tube-length of 170 mm. When using
the oil-immersion objectives it is particularly desirable, that this
exact tube length should be employed. With a view to facilitate the
adjustment of the tube-length the draw tubes of all our larger stands
are graduated in millimeters, the scale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> indicating the exact length of
the microscope tube in any given position of the draw tube. In this
connection it should be remembered, that the width of the collar of the
nose-pieces is 15 millimeters, and that consequently, when a nose-piece
is attached to the tube the reading of the draw tube scale should be 155
mm instead of 170 when the adjustment is proper.</p>

<h4>Figure comparative merits of the dry and immersion systems.</h4>

<p>The above sketch may serve to make clear the advantages of the immersion
objectives over those of the dry series. It is intended to represent
diagrammatically a section through a cover-glass and the front lens of
an objective, one half of the figure representing the conditions present
in the case of the Oil-immersion, the other those which are present in
the dry objectives. It will be noticed that by the interposition of a
drop of oil of the same index of refraction as the glass between the
cover-glass and the objective the refraction which occurs in the dry
system when the light leaves the upper surface of the cover-glass is
done away with. Since this second refraction is attended with much loss
of light it must be evident, that in the immersion system a much greater
quantity of light enters the objective than is possible, other things
being equal, in objectives of the dry system.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>If we let <i>u</i> represent one half the angular aperture of an objective,
represented in the diagram by <i>D'BN</i> in the case of the immersion, and
<i>n</i> the index of refraction of the medium interposed between the
cover-glass and the objective we have in the formula <i>n</i> sin. <i>u</i> a
mathematical expression of the optic power of the various systems of
lenses, or in other words for what is designated the numerical aperture.</p>

<p>The following table gives the numerical apertures of objectives of the
various systems and of various angular apertures. In the dry system
<i>n.</i>, representing the index of refraction of air is taken as 1.00; in
the immersion systems <i>n</i> equals 1.33 for water, 1.52 for cedar oil and
1.66 for monobromnaphthalin. A glance at the table will suffice to show
the great advantage which the immersion objectives have over those of
the dry series.</p>

<h4>Double revolving Eye-piece.</h4>

<p>Until very recently we have manufactured no arrangement for changing
oculars on the microscope. This was due in part to the fact that there
was no great demand for such an accessory and in part to the clumsiness
of all those revolving eye-pieces which changed the entire ocular. The
latter of these difficulties has been overcome in our present revolving
eye-piece by such an adjustment of the collecting or lower lens of the
eye-piece that it may remain permanently in position, the eye lens of
the combination alone moving in the revolver. So accurate is the
construction of the revolver and so carefully are the lenses adjusted
that the eye-pieces may be changed while a specimen is in focus on the
microscope stage without a readjustment of the focus.</p>

<p>The revolving eye-piece is also particularly well adapted to use as a
micrometer ocular, for when the eye lens is turned aside a micrometer
scale may be inserted and rests upon the diaphragm of the eye-piece.
Once adjusted in this way the micrometer values are the same for all the
eye lenses of the combination.</p>

<h2><a name="Stands" id="Stands"></a>Stands.</h2>


<p>For the past thirty years division of labor has been employed to the
utmost possible extent in the manufacture of our microscopes. This
principle has been applied to our machinery as well as to our workmen,
with the result that we have gradually accumulated a large plant of
special machinery of the most accurate construction, each machine
especially adapted to the manufacture of some particular part of our
microscopes. By this development of mechanical appliances for microscope
manufacture two ends have been attained:&mdash;The greatest accuracy and
uniformity of construction of our microscopes has been made possible,
while at the same time it has been possible to cheapen the cost of
manufacture. Instruments which are the product of delicate machinery
must always be more uniform, more accurate and should be less costly
than those manufactured by hand.</p>

<p>In the following remarks we refer more particularly to the larger
microscope stands of our manufacture and draw attention to those
parts which should be present in every well equipped microscope.</p>

<p>The elements of these microscopes are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <b>The foot and upright support with joint for inclination</b>,<br />
2. <b>The stage</b>,<br />
3. <b>The sub-stage, with condenser, iris diaphragm and mirror</b>,<br />
4. <b>The body with the adjustments</b>,<br />
5. <b>The tube, carrying eye-piece, nose-piece and objectives</b>.</p></div>

<p>1. <b>The foot and upright support</b> are solid and are of such weight and
shape as to permit inclination of the body of the microscope to a
horizontal position. The foot is horse-shoe shaped and is made to touch
the table at three points, thus insuring stability even on a surface
which is not entirely level. Inclination of the body of the microscope
is permitted by a joint in the upright, which joint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> may be fastened in
the larger stands by a set-screw operated by a lever. Stands Ia and IIb
are also made with the English foot. Abundant space is left under the
stage for the various attachments of the sub-stage.</p>

<p>2. <b>The stage</b> of Stands A, I, Ia and II is round, revolving and
centering. The centering arrangement consists of two small thumb-screws
so situated at the sides of the stage as to control motion of the stage
in all directions, thus to a limited extent serving the purpose of a
mechanical stage.</p>

<p><b>The other microscope</b> stands have square immovable stages, sufficiently
large for general microscopic work. For the examination of very large
sections two instruments are manufactured: the <u>Nebelthau</u> sliding
microscope (p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>) and the stand after <u>D&ouml;lken</u> (p. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>). The former is
for magnifications up to 120 diam, whereas the latter can be used with
any magnification.</p>

<p>3. <b>The sub-stage</b> carries a plane and concave mirror, the condenser and
the diaphragm for regulating the illumination of the object.</p>

<p><b>The Condenser</b> is so adjusted as to concentrate the rays of light about 2
mm above its surface, which is the average thickness of the microscopic
slides, under an angle equal to the angular aperture of the highest
power objective, which is about 120&deg;.</p>

<p>In the lower power objectives the angular aperture is to be reduced by
the iris diaphragm.</p>

<p>To focus the Condenser properly it is adjustable by rack and pinion
movement on Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, and by side screw on Stands II and IIa.</p>

<p>4. <b>The body</b> of the microscope carries the tube and is fitted with two
adjustments for focussing; a coarse adjustment and a fine adjustment.
The smooth working of these adjustments is one of the chief requirements
of a good microscope.</p>

<p><b>The coarse adjustment</b> consists of rack and pinion and moves the tube of
the microscope in a vertical groove with the least possible friction.
The teeth of the rack and pinion are set obliquely to the axis of the
tube and are so adjusted that two teeth of each are always interlocked,
thus avoiding all possibility of slipping or loss of motion in the
movement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/018.jpg" width="173" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<h4>Figure of the Micrometer-screw of the fine adjustment.</h4>

<p><b>The fine adjustment</b> consists of a micrometer screw which moves the tube
and arm of the microscope supporting the coarse adjustment vertically
upon a triangular column. This column is virtually a continuation upward
of the upright support of the base of the microscope. Around the column
is a broad collar so accurately fitted that it moves smoothly upon it
with a minimum of friction and still without lateral motion, the
movement being controlled by means of a micrometer screw at the top of
the column. The head of this micrometer screw, a section of which is
shown in the accompanying figure, is milled and is graduated in such a
way as to indicate the exact degree of motion of the microscope tube
which is accomplished by turning the micrometer screw, each division of
the graduation corresponding to a motion of the tube through 1/100
millimeter, and a complete revolution of the screw corresponding to a
motion of the tube through &frac12; millimeter. The accuracy of this adjustment
and the smoothness of its motion must be conceded to be a triumph of
mechanical skill.</p>

<p><b>Stands A.</b> and <b>I.</b> are fitted with a <b>new fine adjustment</b> device (one
division on the micrometer screw corresponding to 1/1000 mm.) which is
fully described on pages <a href="#Page_25">25-26</a>.</p>

<p>5. <b>The tube</b> of the microscope encloses a second tube, or draw-tube,
which latter carries the eye-piece, and is so graduated as to indicate
the exact length of tube in use at any time. The lower end of the tube
has a thread into which the various objectives or a nose-piece screw.
Tube and objectives are provided with the so-called "Society screw".</p>

<p><b>The nose-piece</b> has now become an almost indispensable part of a working
microscope. It can, however, be used to best advantage only on such
stands as are provided with a coarse adjustment by rack and pinion.
Aside from the advantage derived from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> rapid changing of objectives,
which it permits, it is so accurately made and centered as to materially
facilitate the focussing of the various objectives. It is only necessary
to focus with the fine adjustment to obtain a view of the same
microscope field which had been under observation before the change was
made.</p>

<p>As it is necessary for this purpose that the objectives should be
accurately adjusted to the nose-piece, it is very desirable that in
ordering an instrument its nose-piece should be ordered at the same time
if one is to be used, as subsequent ordering may necessitate the return
of the stand and objectives to us.</p>

<p><b>Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb and III</b> are those which are best
suited to fine microscopical investigations. Among them the physician
and bacteriologist will find an instrument entirely suited to his
particular needs.</p>

<p><b>Stand III</b> is now provided with rack and pinion adjustment.</p>

<p><b>Stands IV and V</b> are small instruments, which serve nevertheless many
purposes where the more elaborate outfits are unnecessary. They make
excellent laboratory stands for elementary courses in microscopy.</p>

<p>In <b>Stands IV and V</b> the coarse adjustment is by means of sliding tube.
They are all provided with fine adjustment by micrometer screw.</p>

<p><b>Stand VI</b> is provided with rack and pinion adjustment only. It has a
large stage, and is particularly intended for searching for trichinae
and for similar examinations where a very strong durable stand is
desired and where the use of high power objectives is unnecessary. It
may also be useful as an auxiliary stand for purposes of demonstration
in laboratories.</p>

<p><b>Stands III, IV, V, VI</b> have no joint for inclining the body.</p>

<p><b>Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, III, IV</b> have mahogany cases (provided
with a nickelled handle), in which the microscopes stand.</p>

<p><b>Stands V and VI</b> are laid in mahogany boxes.</p>

<p>These cases are furnished with the microscopes without extra charge,
when a <b>complete outfit</b>, including oculars and objectives is purchased.</p>

<p>Object clamps and test objects accompany every microscope.</p>

<p>The objectives to Stands A, I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb are in brass boxes;
those for Stands III, IV, V and VI are in morocco cases.</p>

<h4>a. Illuminating Apparatus of Stands A and I.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The apparatus includes the following parts:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Cylinder iris diaphragm.<br />
Swing-out condenser.<br />
Diaphragm carrier with iris diaphragm.<br />
Plane and concave mirror.</p></div>

<p>The cylinder iris diaphragm comes into play when the condenser is swung
out of position. To do this the diaphragm carrier is turned to the side
as shown in the diagram, a small knob is pressed, which liberates the
condenser, and the latter is swung out to the side.</p>

<p>The regulation of the cylinder iris diaphragm is accomplished by means
of a lever. Before the condenser is swung back into position the
cylinder iris should be opened to its fullest extent. The lower iris
diaphragm is for use in connection with the condenser only. It is
regulated by means of a small knob. A horizontal rack and pinion
arrangement permits oblique illumination, and a vertical rack and pinion
permits adjustment of the whole sub-stage. By these means a most perfect
control of the illumination of the object is assured. Ground or colored
glass discs may be inserted above the iris diaphragm if modification of
the light is desired.</p>

<h4>Stand A.&mdash;Universal Microscope.</h4>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<h3>Stand "A".</h3>

<h4>Universal Microscope.</h4>

<p>In the construction of our new stand "A" we have taken special care to
enlarge all the parts proportionately in order to secure strength and
stability, at the same time adding to the beauty of the instrument.</p>

<p>The upper pillar of the microscope is shaped in such a way as to form a
convenient handle; and to increase the free working space over the
stage, thereby allowing the examination of very large specimen and
culture plates. A specially constructed mechanical stage larger than No.
98 may be attached, which is adapted for slides up to 2&times;4 inches (50&times;100
mm).</p>

<p>The extra large dimensions of all the main parts of this microscope such
as the base and stage etc., allow that freedom of movement so desired in
a stand for photo-micrography.</p>

<p>Both the body tube and graduated draw tube are very wide and permit the
use of low power objectives to cover specimen of large extent; for the
same reason the opening in the stage is very wide but can be narrowed
down by a stop.</p>

<p>The most important innovation on the microscope is the new fine
adjustment device, which is unexcelled both in solidity of construction
and accuracy of movement, representing the highest attainment of the
designers and mechanics skill.</p>

<p>Sectional cuts of this unique arrangement are shown in illustration (p. <a href="#Page_26">26-27</a>).</p>

<p>All that can be seen on the exterior are two small milled heads mounted
below and somewhat back of the two larger knobs controlling the rack and
pinion (coarse) adjustment of the microscope. The knob on the right side
is provided with a graduated drum <i>r</i>, indicating the movement of the
fine adjustment.</p>

<p>The two knobs with drum are mounted on an axle <i>a</i>, which in its central
portion is enlarged and provided with a worm gear. The latter in its
turn drives the gear wheel, <i>d</i>. A spiral spring pressing against one of
the journals into which the axle is mounted prevents any lost motion in
the worm gear. Mounted on the same shaft with the gear-wheel <i>d</i>, is a
heartshaped cam <i>f</i>. On this cam rests the steel roller <i>g</i>, fitted on
the support <i>k</i>, which in its turn carries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> the microscope tube. By its
weight and a spiral spring the latter presses on the cam <i>f</i>, and
effects a direct vertical movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 182px;">
<img src="images/026.jpg" width="182" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The periphery of the heart shaped cam <i>f</i>, is exactly symmetrical and
mathematically correct. The distance traversed by its curved sides from
the lowest to the highest point and vice versa is 3 mm. There are cut 60
teeth in the entire periphery of the gear-wheel <i>d</i>; the number
corresponding to one side of the heart-shaped cam or 3 mm elevation, are
30 teeth, therefore 1 tooth means a movement of 3/30 mm or 0,1 mm.</p>

<p>This in turn requires one complete revolution of the axle <i>a</i>, the drum
of which is graduated into 100 parts. The value of each division on the
drum is therefore 0,1/100=0,001 mm.</p>

<p>This micrometer fine adjustment is exceedingly accurate and reliable,
and besides it has the following advantages;</p>

<p>By virtue of its unique construction the movement is continuous, there
is absolutely no limit to the motion of the micrometer screw, which may
be turned forward or backward as the work requires.</p>

<p>This movement extends in exact ratio to the revolution of the cam for a
distance of 3 mm. As another advantage we may mention, that it is almost
impossible to break the coverglass of the specimen with this fine
adjustment.</p>

<p>Should the objective come in contact with the coverglass and assuming
the knob is turned still further then the tube, which is of aluminium
and very light would simply rest on the specimen, without breaking the
coverglass, as the latter will easily stand the small pressure of the
tube and the fine spiral spring.</p>

moves. The various movements are accomplished by
motion of the microscope on a lateral track upon
its support and by motion of the stage on a similar
track at right angles to the first. The motion of the

<td class="tdl">This microscope corresponds in its dimensions to Stand Ia as
described on page 31. Coarse adjustment by rack and pinion,
fine adjustment by micrometer-screw, the milled head of which
has 50 divisions, each representing a motion of the objective
of 1/100 mm. The condenser, iris-diaphragm and polarizer can
be raised and lowered by rack and pinion. A triple condenser
facilitates the observation of the axial lines in the microscope.
It is so arranged as to be easily replaced by a simple diaphragm-carrier.
By means of a collar attached to the end of
the tube the objective is brought into coincidence with the
centre of the revolving stage. This revolving stage is divided
into 360 degrees and fitted with a vernier and index.
Two scales on the stage, at right angles to each other,
permit accurate location of specimens. The Nicol prism,
which serves as a polarizer, can, after turning the iris-diaphragm
aside, be drawn out from under the latter.
The zero position of the Nicol prism is indicated by a
line, as well as the angles 90, 180, 270&deg;. The analyser
is mounted in metal and is firmly fixed above the
eye-piece. The analyser rotates on a disc graduated to
360 deg. The front of the tube has a movable window
which provides access to the inner tube. In the latter
is an opening for the introduction of a Bertrand lens.
This lens serves the purpose of magnifying the interference
figures produced by the converging rays of
polarized light. This lens and the eye-piece can be
raised or lowered by rack and pinion. In the analyzer
is a slide for the insertion of gypsum and quartz plates
at an angle of 45 degrees.<br />

<p>In many investigations it is advisable to employ
an analyzer introduced laterally into the tube, instead
of the one mentioned above.</p>

Pfeiffer</b> has been constructed in such a way that all parts extending on
both sides can be folded or turned, so that the instrument fits in a
very small case.</p>

<p>The base consists of two parts which may be folded. The stage can be
brought in a position vertical to the optical axis and the metal hand
rests laid on top of the stage. They are connected with the latter by
joints. The mirror can also be turned and put parallel to the pillar.</p>

<p>A round glassplate is set in the stage, below which is an iris diaphragm
to properly regulate the illumination.</p>

<p>The adjustment is by rack and pinion.</p>

<p>Two rightangle prisms are mounted inside the tube in such a manner that
the image obtained by the objective is reflected into the eye-piece and
appears erected.</p>

<p>The eye-piece is of the Ramsden form. Three objectives of different
magnifying power with specially long working-distances have been
constructed Nos. 1, 2, 3.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<td class="tdl"><b>The Photo-micrographic Apparatus</b> consists of a heavy iron
foot supporting a stout column in which another iron support
moves vertically. This latter holds the camera and may be firmly
fixed at any height by means of a thumb-screw. This permits the
accurate adjustment of the camera to microscope stands of various
sizes. The length of the camera is also adjustable by means of a
thumb-screw sliding in the upright support. Regulation of the
field of the camera is accomplished by a revolving disc diaphragm
with openings of five different sizes situated in the neck of the
camera. Two simple plate-holders for plates 9&times;12 and 13&times;18 cm are
supplied with each camera, as are also a ground glass plate and
clear glass plate in the frame of the camera serve to catch the
picture in the plane of the photographic plate, and a simple lens
aids in obtaining a correct focus of the image. A white glass
plate, mounted on a stand is of use in diffusing direct sunlight
so as to make it available for photographic purposes, and three
discs of yellow, blue and green glass are provided which may be
inserted over the iris-diaphragm of the condenser when colored
light is required.<br />

<p>It is of great advantage to interpose an illuminating lens
between the source of light and the mirror, thereby condensing
the light-rays, giving a uniform illumination and preventing the
heating up of the entire stand, which is a disturbing factor in
retaining the focus. The illuminating lens also serves to lessen
the time of exposure.</p>

<p>This photo-micrographic apparatus is also available when it is
desired to photograph gross specimens as, for example, embryos,
insects, etc., by reflected light, as is represented in the
figure on p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>. The photographic objective of 64 mm focal
distance, is best adapted to this purpose. It fits in a collar in
the neck of the camera and yields a magnified image of about 3
diameters. The object is brought into proper focus by means of a
small stand, the table of which may be raised or lowered as
required.</p>

<h2><a name="Large_Projection_Apparatus" id="Large_Projection_Apparatus"></a>Large Projection Apparatus.</h2>

<p>In this projection apparatus an electric projection lamp is made use of,
the lamp being available for electric currents of 20 Amp&egrave;res and about
48 Volts. To regulate the current a rheostat is necessary. When using
constant current the carbons should stand at an angle in order to
utilize to best advantage the stronger light of the positive (upper)
carbon. For spectroscopic projections the carbons of the lamp have to be
in vertical position.</p>

<p>Connected with the lamp is a triple condenser of 150 mm aperture. The
latter should be protected from the heat-rays by a large mica-plate
which is furnished with the apparatus.</p>

<p>Various devices permit very accurate adjustment of the lamp and
condenser. For example, two thumb-screws control the position of the
carbons of the lamp so that the luminous point may be readily brought
into the exact optical axis of the condenser. Again, the two inner
lenses of the condenser are moveable and are controlled by two knobs
conveniently situated as shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>By this adjustment of the lenses of the condenser it is possible to do
away with disturbing chromatic aberration. The rays of light leave the
condenser in moderate convergence.</p>

<p>For direct projection from the preparation the apparatus consists of the
optical bench upon which are mounted the various accessories in proper
succession (Fig. p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>):</p>

<p>1. A large cooling cell, which is to be filled with water or alum
solution.</p>

<p>2. The bellows with tube. This is connected with the cooling cell by
means of a metal ring which slips over the end of the cell and is held
in place by a screw. The metal ring is attached to one end of the
bellows, while the other end carries a large tube.</p>

<p>3. The microscope condensers and diaphragm holder. A larger tube fits
over the tube of the bellows and carries on a revolving arm the cylinder
diaphragm and the two condensers. For low power objectives Nos. 1-3, the
cylinder diaphragm and the condenser of longer focus have to be used.
The latter at the same time serves as the objective for lantern slide
projection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The other condenser is especially needed when high powers are employed
(Objectives 4 to 6). A small rack and pinion arrangement serves for the
adjustment of condenser and diaphragm.</p>

<p>4. The object stage and small cooler. The stage has connected with it a
second cooling cell on which the preparation rests. This arrangement
permits prolonged use of the condenser and the greatest intensity of
light without burning the most delicate specimens. The adjustment of the
object is accomplished by means of an arrangement which permits any
particular point to be brought accurately into the field.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/088.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>5. The objective carrier is provided with a nose-piece for three
objectives, with a broad projection tube, having an Iris diaphragm for
the purpose of narrowing the aperture, and with a narrow tube which
screws into the broad one, in case it is desired to use oculars in
making the projection. The adjustments of the objectives are
accomplished by rack and pinion and by micrometer screw.</p>

<p>In order to change readily from microscopic to lantern-slide projection,
the parts 4 and 5 have been provided with hinges, by means of which they
can be thrown to one side after loosening a lever (see illustration
below).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Wooden cover with cloth curtain which fits over the diaphragm
carrier, the stage and the objectives, to shut off any light which may
escape at the sides.</p>

<p>For the projection of large preparations of from 8-35 mm diameter our
photographic objectives of 24, 35, 42 and 64 mm focal distance are best
adapted (p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>). In connection with these low powers the large tube only
should be used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/089.jpg" width="480" height="361" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>With this projection apparatus the powers of microscope objectives till
number 6 may be well employed.</p>

<p>The picture, even when the highest powers are made use of, and the
screen is at a distance of twelve feet from the apparatus, is of
sufficient clearness and brightness to be available for demonstration to
a large audience.</p>

<p>For the projection of lantern slides or of large section of tissue
following parts of the apparatus are required: Lamp, condenser, cooler
and bellows are the same as in the above described apparatus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The stage and objective carrier are swung to one side.</p>

<p>The special-projection lens of 300 mm focal distance is to be used.</p>

<p>A slide carrier slips into the frame of the bellows, which is
sufficiently large to accommodate lantern slides 9&times;10 and 9&times;12 cm in
size. The slide carrier has a stop at both ends which facilitates its
adjustment in the axis of the instrument, and is arranged for the
simultaneous reception of two slides, so that while one is being
projected it may be charged with a second which may then without delay
be pushed into the optical axis as the first is removed. In this way
series of pictures may be thrown on the screen without interruption.</p>

<p>When so arranged the projection can be made upon a screen 30 feet from
the apparatus, over the heads of an audience.</p>

<h4>Large Sliding-Microtome.</h4>


<p>Our larger microtomes are heavy and all their adjustments are of the
most accurate construction, the result being that they are very steady
when in use and permit the cutting of very thin and uniform sections.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>They are to be had in three different sizes. The larger two are slightly
different in construction from the third. The two former microtomes are
provided with an automatic feed attachement. A heavy knife-carrier
slides smoothly and rapidly on a horizontal track and is so arranged
that it may be manipulated by the hand of the operator alone or by a
wheel and chain device, which tends to assure a perfectly uniform stroke
of the knife.</p>

<p>The objectclamp is raised vertically by a micrometer screw. This motion
is accomplished by turning a large disc having teeth cut into its
periphery and a turn of one tooth being equal to an elevation of 0.0025
mm.</p>

<p>The automatic feed is arranged as follows: With each return of the
knife-carrier to the end of its track pressure is made upon an
adjustable lever which regulates the motion of the micrometer wheel.
This device may be so adjusted as to move the micrometer disc any number
of teeth from one to ten with each sweep of the knife.</p>

<p>Three different forms of clamps may be had for these microtomes, and
freezing apparatus as well as paraffin tables can also be fitted.</p>

<p>The Fixed clamp, No. 128, represented in the figure of the large sliding
microtome, serves to clamp the specimen in position and does not allow
any further adjustment.</p>

<p>The Ball and Socket clamp permits the adjustments of the specimen after
it is held in the clamp by means of a ball and socket joint&mdash;see figure
of No. 129&mdash;a set-screw then holds it firmly in position.</p>

<p>The Naples clamp permits the accurate adjustment of the specimen at any
level, the clamp being supported on two horizontal axes at right angles
to each other, the one controlled by rack and pinion, the other by
endless screw.</p>

<p>The knife-carrier is arranged to hold the Thoma form knives, which are
fastened by means of a wing-screw. Other knives require a special
holder, such as No. 139.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
